 Yes,in all seriousness,he was a beautiful mind. I view him as a man  of compromise,that hopefully the God(s) will allow me to see him again. I believe he is an example of faith,and was also a man of compromise. I view him as a man who is like an Instagram thot,one who knows she is sinning,but still has faith that God will not only forgive her,but loves God and assumes God loves her back. Terry was much the same way. He made his followers happy and joyfull and loving through his controversial humor . He embodied a life of selflessness,knowing he would be oppressed for his views,and even when oppressed for his faith in mental hospitals,he ignored it and continued to be terry. 

He lived a life of poverty for us,and died a tragedy. I sometimes wonder he killed himself by going in front of the train as a self-sacrifice. He sinned against his Lord,and decided to repent. It embodies the expression of the self in the eyes of what i see as "the God". One who wants us to suffer for reasons that are ultimately unknown or "up to interpretation".  I honestly see him as a self-martyr. In the prime of his fandom,he renounced it out of reverence for his Lord.

I see myself in him.I see a man who wants to "live it up",but knows it is a sin-not jsut a minor one,but huge one. He puts faith in him,knowing that he will be judged,but takes a risk in wanting to please others. He is a repented satan. A satan that refused to bow down to God,not because he was disobedient,but because he loved God: he couldn't fathom bowing down before anyone else beyond what he was used to(pleasing others),so he was forced to make a choice,he made a wrong one,but... unlike satan he made a sacrifice to change his ways forever... and death was the only way he could do that
